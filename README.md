# 64-Bit Full-Adder with UPduino 3.1 FPGAs
A SystemVerilog implementation of a 10-bit ripple-carry adder for the UPduino 3.1 FPGA. This project demonstrates a purely combinational adder design using only XOR, AND, and OR gates, without relying on the + operator. The design is fully synthesizable with the iCE40 toolchain (apio / IceStorm).
